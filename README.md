# Predicting-Bank-Fraud
In todayâ€™s digital era, while financial transactions have brought unparalleled convenience, they have also heightened the risk of fraudulent activities. Fraud not only results in financial losses but also undermines customer trust in banking institutions. Detecting and preventing fraud has become a pressing challenge for banks, demanding innovative and scalable solutions.

This project focuses on developing a predictive model using the Bank Account Fraud dataset (sourced from Kaggle NeurIPS 2022) to identify potential fraudulent activities. Fraud detection is pivotal in the financial sector, as accurate predictions can significantly reduce financial losses and restore customer confidence.

Our objective is to determine the most effective model for identifying bank fraud, enabling banks to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent customers effectively.
